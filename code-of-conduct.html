    <h3 class="font-weight-bold">NACOSS-AKSU Code of Conduct</h3>

    <p>The community is made of up of undergraduate students in the Department of Computer Science who are working on
      every aspect of the mission.</p>

    <p>As a community based in the University, it is likely that there could be breakdown in communictation and
      potential unhappiness or discontent with some behaviour. As such, it is imperative that some ground rules are set
      and these are to be strictly adhered to, regardless of status or position within the community. The code applies
      to everyone involved.</p>

    <p>The idea is not to create an exhaustive list of do nots, rather it is guide to enable ease of collaboration
      within the community which will further improve the community and enhance growth. This code of conduct applies to all spaces managed by the NACOSS-AKSU community including off site group chats on
      Facebook, WhatsApp or another other means of communication that may arise in the future. In addition, violations
      of this code outside these spaces may affect a person's ability to participate within them.</p>

    <p>If you believe someone is violating the code of conduct, we ask that you
      report it by emailing
      <a href="mailto:jeff.ogah@gmail.com">jeff.ogah@gmail.com</a> or any other executive of the association</a></p>

      <li><strong>Friendly, patient and accomodating.</strong> Understand that not everyone might work or understand at
        your pace and seek to slow down and take time to assist others. Likewise, do not take unjust advantage of any
        one being nice, any aid being received is of benevolence and not as an entitlement. Understand the right way to
        approach someone for help</li>
      <li><strong>Considerate.</strong> As a community, you cease to exist alone and in some manner, even little actions
        you take will affect the community in some way or the other. Understand that your decisions can potentially
        affect others and take consequences into accout in order to positively impact the community. </li>

      <li><strong>Welcoming and encouraging.</strong> By default, this community includes the students of the Department

        background and do not ostracize or make anyone feel left out.</li>

      <li><strong>Respectful.</strong> As much as it's impossible for everyone to agree on everything, that doesn't
